For this project, I scraped IMDb and analyzed movie trends, making predictions on the IMDb rating based on different sets of features.

An interactive presentation can be found [here](https://prezi.com/view/MzamVam1yzys9d5m8mXq).

This project repository contains a folder with the work done for scraping and several notebooks where I processed and modeled the data. The presentation gives a brief overview of my work.
